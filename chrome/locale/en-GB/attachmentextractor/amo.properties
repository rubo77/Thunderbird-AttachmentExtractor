Name=AttachmentExtractor
Summary=Extracts all attachments from selected messages and then can delete, detach or mark-read.
Description=Just select the messages containing the attachments you want to extract and select 'Extract Attachments' and this extension does the rest. No more having to go through each message to extract the attachments!\nCheck out the settings dialog for the different options.
PrivacyPolicy=The first time you run Attachment Extractor the extension loads a window with cut down version of the changelog on my website. To do this a webpage is loaded with the extension name and version as parameters (so I can display the correct version). I don't collect any information off you or your Thunderbird installation/profile, personally identifiable or otherwise.
VersionNotes=*improvement: stopped loading images in the background prior to saving them as this can be very slow, especially in Thunderbird 3. My tests showed an up to 200% boost by blocking images. Can be reenabled if nessecary by setting (hidden) preference attachmentextractor.dontloadimages to false.\n* bug fix: cleartag with autoextract now correctly clearing tag. [bug #36]\n* bug fix: Detaching failed on macOS (in 1.2.1 changelog, missing from release) [bug #59]\n* bug fix: Multiple email sequence fail (collision) with auto-extract. (in 1.2.1 changelog, missing from release) [bug #52]
DeveloperComments=After you've used AttachmentExactractor for a while please come back and write a review.\n\nIf you find any bugs, or want to request a new feature please use the bugtracker on my website. Use the feedback form on my website(in the 'contact me' section) to ask me any questions - asking a query or mentioning a bug in the discussions section is less practical because I'm not going to be able to answer unless I happen to check here.
